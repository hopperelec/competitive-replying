A game where people are ranked on how well they can respond to prompts.

Any player can submit a prompt. It could be a question, a challenge or a lead-up to a joke.

For each prompt, players can choose to either write a reply ("repliers") or rate other people's replies ("raters").

- Repliers aren't able to view other people's replies until they have finished writing their own.
- Raters get to upvote or downvote each reply given to the prompt.

Until at least two replies to a prompt have been voted on,
nobody is able to see who wrote each reply nor how many upvotes/downvotes each reply has.

After those 30 seconds are up, players stop being able to write and rate replies, and the winning reply is determined.

Each reply is scored by subtracting the number of downvotes from the number of upvotes.
The winning reply for each prompt is that with the highest score.
